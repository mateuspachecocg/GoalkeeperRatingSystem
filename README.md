## Basic Information

This project was developed as a way to obtain a grade in the object-oriented programming discipline using the Java programming language.


##  Oriented Object Programming

The system was developed using the object-oriented programming paradigm (OOP), the OOP is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. 

##  What does this system do?

The Goalkeeper Rating System (GRS) is responsible for, from data on goalkeepers, shots and training sessions, abstract and calculate statistics on the performance of goalkeepers registered in the system.

##  Main Challenge
The main challenges to develop this project were:
- Design a mapping system for the possibilities of the goalkeeper's area of action as well as the shots that are defended or not by them.
- Calculate the goalkeeper's areas of action without the use of matrices.
- Check events like:
  - There was a save by the goalkeeper
  - It was not a defense because the goalkeeper had no power greater than the kick.
  - There was a goal.
